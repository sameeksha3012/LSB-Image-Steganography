# LSB-Image-Steganography
Developed a C-based CLI tool to hide/extract text in .bmp images using LSB steganography. Validates message size vs. image capacity, embeds a magic string for identification, and supports encoding/decoding via arguments. Demonstrates file handling, bitwise ops, and secure, invisible data embedding without altering image quality.
